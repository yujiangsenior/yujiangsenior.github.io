    <h1>Welcome to My Research Webpage</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Greetings</h2>
        <p>Welcome! I am excited to share my academic journey, research, and achievements with you. This webpage highlights my work in data-driven modeling, machine learning, and process optimization, which I believe are crucial for advancing industrial processes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a PhD student at University College Cork, where my research focuses on developing learned simulators to optimize industrial processes through machine learning and reduced-order models.</p>
        <p>Previously, I served as a Research/IT Assistant at Westlake University, CenBRAIN, where I supported advanced research projects and managed IT infrastructure from January 2019 to March 2021. I also worked as a Quantitative Analyst in the futures research industry in 2018, applying machine learning algorithms for market prediction, and as a piping engineer for 3 years, where I contributed to system designs and optimization.</p>
        <p>I hold a BE from Zhejiang University (2011) and an ME from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2014).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>During my first job, I have developed 2 GUI programs for improving the working efficiency as a piping system designer, which is based on Matlab, SQL and can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/yujiangsenior/gui-program-for-piping-valve-query-in-matlab">here</a>. </p>
        <p>During my second job, I have implemented various machine learning algorithms using Python as the basis for further quantitative analysis of financial market, including Principal Component Analysis, Hidden Markov Model, Kernel-based Fisher Classification, Spectral Clustering, Emperical Mode Decomposition, Recurrent Neural Networks </p>
        <p>During my third job, I have gained experience in neural network training pipeline using Pytorch, Shell scripting experience in Linux, and webpage frontend development in HTML/CSS/Javascripts</p>
        <p>During my PhD study, I mainly rely on Tensorflow data pipeline and Pytorch training pipeline to develop reduced order modeling based on <a href="https://github.com/uccproc/gns4demdesign">Graph Neural Networks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uccproc/dpca_transformer_ROM">Transformer</a>, etc</p>
