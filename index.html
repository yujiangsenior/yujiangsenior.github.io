    <h1>Welcome to My Research Webpage</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Greetings</h2>
        <p>Hi all, this is my personal webpage! I am thrilled to share my academic journey, research work, and achievements with you.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a PhD student at University College Cork, focusing on developing learned simulators aimed at optimizing industrial processes.</p>
        <p>My previous experience includes working as a Research/IT assistant at Westlake University, CenBRAIN, from January 2019 to March 2021. Prior to that, I worked as a quantitative analyst in a futures research organization in the year 2018 and spent 3 years as a piping engineer.</p>
        <p>I graduated in 2011 with a BE from Zhejiang University and in 2014 with a ME from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
