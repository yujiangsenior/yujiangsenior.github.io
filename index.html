    <h1>Welcome to My Research Webpage</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Greetings</h2>
        <p>Welcome! I am excited to share my professional and academic journey, research, and achievements with you. This webpage highlights my work in <b>data-driven modeling</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, and <b>process optimization</b>, which I believe are crucial for advancing industrial processes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a PhD candidate (expect to graduate 2025.11) at <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/">University College Cork</a>, where my research focuses on developing learned simulators to optimize industrial processes through machine learning and reduced-order models.</p>
        <p>Previously, I served as a Research/IT Assistant at <a href="https://cenbrain.westlake.edu.cn/">Westlake University, CenBRAIN</a>, where I supported advanced research projects and managed IT infrastructure from January 2019 to March 2021. I also worked as a Quantitative Analyst in the <a href="https://www.nanhua.net/">futures research industry</a> in 2018, applying machine learning algorithms for market prediction, and as a piping design engineer in <a href="https://www.chinacuc.com/">Hangzhou</a> for 3 years, where I contributed to system designs and optimization.</p>
        <p>I hold a BE from Zhejiang University (2011) and an ME from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2014).</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>During my 1st job, I have developed 2 GUI programs for improving the working efficiency as a piping system designer, which is based on Matlab, SQL and can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/yujiangsenior/gui-program-for-piping-valve-query-in-matlab">here</a>. </li>
            <li>During my 2nd job, I have implemented various machine learning algorithms using Python as the basis for further quantitative analysis of financial market, including Principal Component Analysis, Hidden Markov Model, Kernel-based Fisher Classification, Spectral Clustering, Emperical Mode Decomposition, Recurrent Neural Networks </li>
            <li>During my 3rd job, I have gained experience in neural network training pipeline using Pytorch, Shell scripting experience in Linux, and webpage frontend development in HTML/CSS/Javascripts</li>
            <li>During my PhD research, I mainly rely on Tensorflow data pipeline and Pytorch training pipeline to develop reduced order modeling based on <a href="https://github.com/uccproc/gns4demdesign">Graph Neural Networks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uccproc/dpca_transformer_ROM">Transformer</a>, etc</li>
            <li>During my intern in <a href="https://engipower.com/">startup</a> in Hangzhou, I develped digital twins for thermal systems in power plants using MLP and Transformer</li>
        </ul>
